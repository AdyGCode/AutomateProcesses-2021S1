Week 03 demonstrations

This is a markdown file.

On GITHUB this will be displayed
similar to a web page.

## Exercise 1

- Create an HTML page called `ex-01.html` in the `wk-03` folder
- Make sure you change the title to "Week 03 | Exercise 1"
- Create a JS file in the JS folder named `ex-01.js`
- Write a simple JS script to display the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive

## Exercise 2
- Create an HTML page called `ex-02.html` in the `wk-03` folder
- Make sure you change the title to "Week 03 | Exercise 2"
- Create a JS file in the JS folder named `ex-02.js`
- Create a JS script that, shows the 11 times table for the numbers
1 to 12. The output for each line should be in the form `10 * 11 = 110`
  
## Exercise 3
- Create an HTML page called `ex-03.html` in the `wk-03` folder
- Make sure you change the title to "Week 03 | Exercise 3"
- Create a JS file in the JS folder named `ex-03.js`
- Write the JS code to display a triangle in the form:
```*
**
***
****
```
- The triangle will have a variable called `height` that you set to 7
by default. The resulting triangle will have 7 lines in height.
- Change the 7 to 12 and make sure the triangle outputs as expected.
